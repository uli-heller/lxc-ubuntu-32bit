Description: debhelper add-on for packaging software written in Go (golang)
 dh-golang provides a debhelper sequence addon named 'golang', a buildsystem
 module named 'golang' and a command called dh_golang.
 .
 The golang debhelper buildsystem is designed to make packaging programs
 written in Go very simple.

Description: Go programming language -- gccgo
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
 modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
 convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
 interpreted language.
 .
 Installing this package will install the gccgo implementation as /usr/bin/go.
 It conflicts with golang-go.

Description: Native Go bindings for the FUSE kernel module
 This package offers native Go bindings for FUSE, and has several features:
 .
  * High speed: as fast as libfuse using the gc compiler for single
    threaded loads.
 .
  * Supports in-process mounting of different FileSystems onto
    subdirectories of the FUSE mount.
 .
  * Supports 3 interfaces for writing filesystems:
    - PathFileSystem: define filesystems in terms path names.
    - NodeFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of inodes.
    - RawFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of FUSE's raw
      wire protocol.
 .
  * Both NodeFileSystem and PathFileSystem support manipulation of true
    hardlinks.
 .
 The package also includes two fleshed out examples, zipfs and unionfs.
