Description: Go programming language -- gccgo
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore
 and networked machines, while its novel type system enables flexible and
 modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to machine code yet has the
 convenience of garbage collection and the power of run-time reflection. It's a
 fast, statically typed, compiled language that feels like a dynamically typed,
 interpreted language.
 .
 Installing this package will install the gccgo implementation as /usr/bin/go.
 It conflicts with golang-go.

Description: Go programming language -- gccgo on "non-Go" platforms
 The Go programming language is an open source project to make programmers more
 productive. Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of multicore

 This is a dependency package that depends on the default Go toolchain and
 compiled standard library or gccgo on architectures that do not have a native
 toolchain ("gc compiler") port. Because the gccgo and Go releases are not on
 the same schedule, it is not guaranteed that the version of the Go language
 provided by the version of gccgo that this package depends upon will match the
 version of this package.

Description: Native Go bindings for the FUSE kernel module
 This package offers native Go bindings for FUSE, and has several features:
 .
  * High speed: as fast as libfuse using the gc compiler for single
    threaded loads.
 .
  * Supports in-process mounting of different FileSystems onto
    subdirectories of the FUSE mount.
 .
  * Supports 3 interfaces for writing filesystems:
    - PathFileSystem: define filesystems in terms path names.
    - NodeFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of inodes.
    - RawFileSystem: define filesystems in terms of FUSE's raw
      wire protocol.
 .
  * Both NodeFileSystem and PathFileSystem support manipulation of true
    hardlinks.
 .
 The package also includes two fleshed out examples, zipfs and unionfs.
